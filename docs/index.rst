surpyval
=====================================

*surpyval* is an implementation of survival analysis in Python. The intent of this was to see if I could actually make it, and therefore learn a lot about survival statistics along the way, but also so that each time a model is created, it can be reused by other planned projects for monte carlo simulations (used in reliability engineering) and optimisations.

Specifically, surpyval was designed to be used for the front end statistical analysis for the repyability package. The repyability package is a reliability engineering software package for engineers.


Installation
------------------------------

Because someone beat me to putting 'surpyval' on pypi, i've settled with:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install reliafy-surpyval
